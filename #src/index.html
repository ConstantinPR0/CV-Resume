									<h2>About me</h2>
									<p>All my life I was looking towards IT technologies, for me it seemed that I was far from
										this, although the computer accompanied me in all spheres of my life: school, university,
										work and home. Self-development and moving forward desire pushed to study of frontend
										development, so I became very happy when I finally realized, that programming is my
										vocation, the dream of my whole life lies in. The main goal is motivation to learn new
										technologies. I feel that the conquest of the world is getting closer every day ...</p>
									<p>My <b>primary goal</b> is to become a front-end developer, and my <b>secondary
											goal</b> is to become a lead developer.</p>
									<h4 class="spoiler__click">Little histiory (spoiler - click here to open) </h4>
									<p class="spoiler"> I graduated from Kurgan State University with a degree in “Technical and
										Environmental Safety”. This specialty is not related with information technologies at all,
										but all the time I was studying, I tried to automate my study with help of computer and
										different programs, for example, formulas in Excel helped me to write my course works
										quickly. Then I went to the army. In the army I had a goal to get to the rank of a junior
										sergeant and my work in the army was directly related to the programs on computers. I
										graduated from the army with the rank of junior sergeant. Next, when I came home, I took a
										job as a safety engineer. This time I also had the goal of becoming an executive in my
										field, and a year later I took a management position with an auditing company that
										provided services to other companies.
									</p>
									<p class="spoiler">
										Another six months later, I was hired by a fairly large energy company in the city, took
										an executive position in my field, and supervised occupational safety specialists in eight
										branches in different cities. My salary was above average in Russia, but at that point,
										after several months of work, I realized that I don’t want to advance in this field of
										work anymore. As it did not develop me in any way, I began to feel that I was standing
										still, and suddenly it occurred to me to leave my job and find myself in something that
										would bring pleasure, where I could learn new things and improve myself every day.
									</p>
									<p class="spoiler">
										I started with web design and did a short 7-day marathon on creating a landing page, which
										I finished, and learned how to use Photoshop. Since then I periodically draw something in
										Photoshop for different projects. Next, I decided to get acquainted with the layout
										(programming still seemed complicated for me, so I decided to start with something simple)
										- and I did a 3-day marathon to create my own mini-page, written in HTML and CSS, after
										writing the code in VS-code, I realized that this is what I am interested in. After a
										while, my friend invited me to the HTML-Academy where I started to learn JavaScript, and I
										liked it. I solved all the additional tasks in JS and passed all the subjects in a month,
										and after that I was finally convinced that programming is what I want to devote my life
										to. Sometimes I write code at night and I don't feel sleepy at all, but I’m trying to
										watch over my health. Then I discovered learn.javascript.ru and accidentally found the
										RSSchool course in the comments. I have now completed JS/FE PRE-SCHOOL Stage#0 and have
										enrolled in JS/Frontend-development Stage#1. Now I can say with full confidence - I will
										become a
										programmer - it's only a matter of time.
